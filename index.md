### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it kicked things off to a nice
    start in coding. It was a good way to start the lab class and a nice
    walkthrough which taught us what to expect and learn in class and how
    the partnering and the driver and navigator technique works.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was also one of my favorites because it was interesting how
    a code runs and shows patterns with and using loops. It was the most
    interesting lab in my opinion because I learned that a code does not
    necessary need to be long for it to run a decently sized pattern.
    It was interesting how a code with the line length of 20 is able to
    run and print 22 rows and 23 columns of lines and dashes that forms
    a pattern.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my favorties as well because it was a nice
    code to learn and end the lab class. It was great learning how to write
    codes and debug images to creatand run an animated image. However, the
    thing that caught my interest the most in this lab was learning how codes
    that consists of letters and numbers are able to make an animated image.
